            <p>
              Hi! I'm Leo, a designer with over 10 years of experience
              transforming ideas into digital products. My journey began in
              graphic design, evolved into digital marketing, and solidified in
              UX/UI, where I've specialized my focus on creating user-centered
              experiences. For the past 2 years, I've been working as a Product
              Designer, leading the design of solutions that directly impact
              business operations and productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've worked across diverse contexts: agencies, startups, and
              freelance projects, which has given me a comprehensive view of the
              digital product lifecycle. Currently, I'm part of the team at
              GeoVictoria, a SaaS technology company specialized in human
              capital management, where I design solutions that help over 7,000
              clients across 20 countries optimize their HR processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              My transition into Front End development is a natural evolution of
              my career. I've always worked hand-in-hand with development teams,
              which has allowed me to deeply understand the relationship between
              design and code. I'm currently completing a Front End Development
              bootcamp, mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while learning
              React and C#. Additionally, I've developed personal video game
              projects in code, which reinforces my ability to materialize ideas
              from concept to implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is to integrate design and development to have full
              control over digital product creation, building experiences that
              not only look good but function optimally and scale effectively.
            </p>
